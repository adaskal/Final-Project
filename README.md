# Final-Project

Toolboxes/add ons that need to be downloaded: IPython, tabulate

Our project includes 4 tests: number memory test, verbal memory test, reaction time test, and typing test. 

Number memory test: 
Player is given a number and has to input that number back. If the player inputs the correct number they can continue and the next number that is one digit longer pops up. If they are able to do this for an eleven digit number the game stops and the player wins. 


Verbal memory test:
Player is given list of 10 random words at beginning of test.  At end of test, they are presented with a different list of 10 words and asked to recall if any of the new words are in the old word list.  Uses a True/False quiz mechanic.


Reaction time test:
This is a simple reaction time test. The test is meant to test the reaction time to a box pop up as well as a sound. For the first test the player must click the box and hit enter as soon as he/she sees it pop up. For the second test he/she must wait until the sound finishes playing to click and hit enter on the box. The final code is just a quick way to compare your results.  

Typing test: 
The player is given a passage to type. When the player finishes typing the passage, their results (WPM, accuracy, time) are printed. If their WPM is in the top 3 entries and their accuracy is >= 75%, their name is added to the leaderboard.
